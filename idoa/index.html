        <h3 class="entry-title">What is <strong>The International Day of Awesomeness</strong>?</h3> 
        <p class="entry-content"><strong>The International Day of Awesomeness</strong> is a celebration of <em>awesomeness</em>.  People are <em>awesome</em> every day, frequently don't realize it, and their <strong>feats of awesomeness</strong> are rarely recognized.  We aim to fix that, with a special day to both perform and celebrate <strong>feats of awesomeness</strong>!</p>

        <h3 class="entry-title">How Can I Celebrate <strong>The International Day of Awesomeness</strong>?</h3> 
        <p class="entry-content">The easiest way to celebrate <strong>The International Day of Awesomeness</strong> is to be <em>awesome</em>.  You could organize a group of your friends to perform <strong>feats of awesomness</strong> with.  You could write a blog entry about someone you think epitomizes the ideals of <em>awesomeness</em>.  As we get closer to <span title="March 10, 2008">the day</span>, we'll have more concrete tips for things you can do to celebrate this very important (but fun, fun, fun - we can't stress that enough - <strong>The International Day of Awesomeness</strong> should be fun and not taken too seriously).</p>

        <h3 class="entry-title">Where Did You Idiots Come Up With <strong>The International Day of Awesomeness</strong>?</h3> 
        <div class="entry-content">
          <p>This is mostly the fault of <a href="http://lawver.net">Kevin Lawver</a> (that's me). At work, on August 6th, 2007, one of our interns (Freddie Maneiro) suggested that we have a celebration of my awesomeness (it's been a running joke on this project).  This cracked me up, and I said there should be a <strong>International Day of Awesomeness</strong>, and said that I'd post it to <a href="http://twitter.com">twitter</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/kplawver/statuses/190039452">which I did</a>.  That started a very funny, very un-serious conversation among my friends about just what this holiday would entail.  And well, here we are.</p>
          <p><strong>The International Day of Awesomness</strong> occurs every year on March 10th.  Why?  Because that's Chuck Norris' birthday.  No offense to Mr. Norris, but this isn't really a salute to Chuck Norris, the man.  This is a tribute to the <em>awesomeness</em> of the <a href="http://www.chucknorrisfacts.com/">the myth of Chuck Norris</a> (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Norris_Facts">the Wikipedia entry</a>). <strong>The International Day of Awesomeness</strong> is also strongly inspired by <a href="http://zefrank.com/theshow">The Show with Ze Frank</a>.  Ze's year-long internship in the <strong>League of Awesomeness</strong> is something special, and if you didn't experience while it was going on, you should go back and watch the shows.  Ze and his audience frequently performed <strong>feats of awesomeness</strong>, which could be used as inspiration for your own feats.</p>
          <p><a href="http://geekfriendly.org/blog">Dan Lurie</a> came up with the original tag line ("Because everyone needs an excuse to be awesome"), and my son, Max, came up with the new one.  A bunch of people endorsed the date. I'm open to suggestions for where we take this next.  This is a single page and only took about an hour to build.  The domain name only took about five minutes to register.  What I've done so far is not awesome, but I think this day could be extremely <em>awesome</em>.  <a href="mailto:lawver-at-gmail.com">Any ideas are welcome</a>!</p>
          <p>So, there you have it: <strong>The International Day of Awesomeness</strong>.  How will you be <em>awesome</em>?  What <strong>feats of awesomeness</strong> will you perform?</p>
          <p>If you're planning an event for <strong>The International Day of Awesomeness</strong>, <a href="http://eventful.com/events/E0-001-005545557-3">Chris Radcliff has set up an umbrella event you can post your event to</a>!</p>

        <h3 class="entry-title"><strong>The <em>Inter</em>national Day of Awesomeness</strong>?</h3>
        <div class="entry-content">
          <p>If you were here the first day, you know this started as the <strong>National Day of Awesomeness</strong>, but, thanks to <a href="http://www.365questions.org/2007/08/07/national-day-of-awesomeness-isnt-it-awesome/">a blog post</a>, I realized that confining the day to one nation was aiming low - and being awesome is definitely not about aiming low.  So, I need some translation help!  If you'd like to translate this page, please do!  Just <a href="mailto:lawver-at-gmail.com">send me the text</a> and I'll create a new version!  There will probably be a blog here at some point, which will be in English, but this page's content should remain pretty much the same.  We'll just build things up around it.  Thanks!</p>
