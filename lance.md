Happy birthday Kevin!

Really glad you're part of the team. Your doodling skills are unmatched and you're the special ingredient that makes every stand-up fun. I can't believe it's been 5 months since we both started together on "Team New Guy". Pour yourself a big old cup of coffee and celebrate.

P.S. Thanks for introducing me to marrow!
