Happy 23rd Birthday Kevin! You are the absolute bomb-diggity. I'm so happy you are on the team because you make me feel young again, and because I've never met anyone else with as big of an obsession with corgis. If I were to create a holiday, I would create a What Would Kevin Do day.

Happy Birthday Kevin!
I've learned so much from you since you joined the team. Not just with coding but about life things too.
If more people made you a role model, the world would be a pretty great place.
Hope you like the poster! Sorry it's not of our app's source code... thinking about security.
I almost included a generated API doc but I felt that was kind of iffy too.
Anyway, here's to many more years of you sharing awesome foods, ideas, and getting shit done!

Happy Birthday Kevin! Thank you for everything you taught me. My takeaways from your valuable insight: Curated monthly box services are mostly garbage and a waste of money, never mix PHP into your Rails, and most importantly, Sriracha goes with everything. Enjoy your 40's. :)

Happy birthday Kevin!

Really glad you're part of the team. Your doodling skills are unmatched and you're the special ingredient that makes every stand-up fun. I can't believe it's been 5 months since we both started together on "Team New Guy". Pour yourself a big old cup of coffee and celebrate.

-Lance

P.S. Thanks for introducing me to marrow!
