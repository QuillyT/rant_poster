Happy Birthday Kevin!
I've learned so much from you since you joined the team. Not just with coding but about life things too.
If more people made you a role model, the world would be a pretty great place.
Hope you like the poster! Sorry it's not of our app's source code... thinking about security.
I almost included a generated API doc but I felt that was kind of iffy too.
Anyway, here's to many more years of you sharing awesome foods, ideas, and getting shit done!
