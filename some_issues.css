ISSUE 204 - 30TH NOVEMBER

I had huge fun at the New Directions in Operating Systems conference this week and have included a few related posts and presentations in this issue. Small, super-niche, community conferences like this, Monitorama and Configuration Management Camp feel like great places to learn new things - thanks to all the people who organise them.

NEWS

If you missed out on New Directions in Operating systems this week this epic post of notes from all of the talks should be of interest. Lots of talk of rump kernels, unikernels, configuration management and more.

http://www.syslog.cl.cam.ac.uk/2014/11/25/new-directions-in-operating-systems/

My talk at New Directions in Operating Systems, all about the history and possible future of configuration management as both a discipline and an evolving tool set.

https://speakerdeck.com/garethr/configuration-management-for-future-operating-systems

One of the common threads at New Directions in Operating Systems was a move towards a different mental model of the operating system. This talk did a good job of articulating some of the reasons why.

http://www.slideshare.net/alexisrichardson/71-myths-of-the-new-os

Details from a recent survey of the state of monitoring have started to be published, with some interesting results. So far you can have a look at the demographics of respondents, and see what tools people are using today.

http://www.hurryupandwait.io/blog/configure-and-test-windows-infrastructure-using-powershell-technologies-dsc-and-pester-running-from-chef-and-test-kitchen

A good post on the ongoing enterprise devops debate, making the point that talking about application and practices that work is a good thing, and doing so with empathy for all involved is important.

http://blog.ingineering.it/post/100180001529/we-get-the-enterprise-devops-we-deserve

If you’re running Kafka then this next post, about load testing Kafka on AWS, will definitely be essential reading. Even if you’re not the details and approach to load testing are interesting.

http://grey-boundary.com/load-testing-apache-kafka-on-aws/

Wiring well behaved unix command line tools doesn’t take lots of work, but you do need to know the basics. This presentation demonstrates catching signals, dealing with stdin and stdout and more using Ruby.

http://www.slideshare.net/bigfishdesign/well-behaved-unix

A great practical post on team organisation, bridging both development and operations work, as well as planned and ad-hoc tasks. Lots of good points and observations, if you’re organising or working on a team you should read this.

http://theagileadmin.com/2014/09/30/scrum-for-operations-just-add-devops/

A Gartner piece entitled Seven Steps to Start Your DevOps Initiative. Lots of good observations in here, and the key challenges picked out are interesting if you’re talking with your CIO or similar level execs.

http://www.gartner.com/technology/reprints.do?ct=140925&id=1-22AAXZR&st=sb

An interesting talk from the recent Devopsdays Chicago, entitled Rules of DevOops, all about making mistakes. Lots of observations about how teams work and communicate, and why abstractions can hurt team work.

ISSUE 196 - 5TH OCTOBER

I talked at PupppetConf about how I think we’re still edging slowly towards infrastructure as code. A few of the links before point in that direction, with automated test suites for black box services, interactive ways of exploring infrastructure and tools for learning to code. More of the same please.

NEWS

A good write-up from my old colleagues about how they approached writing acceptance tests for a Content Distribution Network. Black box testing like this feels useful for a bunch of different services or devices.

https://gdstechnology.blog.gov.uk/2014/10/01/cdn-acceptance-testing/

Devops owes lots to the discussion of agile that came before it, one of those discussions being around the importance of cross functional teams. This post stresses why having a real team is so important.

http://www.leadingagile.com/2014/10/teams-101/

This next post talks about the importance to code review, and about making that easier with pre-checks like static analysis. The reason I like it is because it shows how simple this can be in trivial cases. Easy to forget when moving to describing infrastructure as code.

http://infiniteundo.com/post/22292945729/one-line-of-code

If you’ve managed a reasonable sized AWS infrastructure you’ll probably have spent at least some time looking for an instance based on incomplete data. Skew sounds an interesting solution, I’m particularly interested in seeing the IPython Notebook integration.

http://lexical.scopely.com/2014/09/29/skew/

It’s been a week or since PuppetConf 2014 now so most of the slides are now available online. That’s nearly 100 presentations to keep you busy.

http://www.slideshare.net/PuppetLabs/tag/puppetconf-2014

Quite a few nice points in this interview with RedHat CEO putting the business spin on devops. Interesting following the CEO/CIO discussions around something that is so community driven.

http://www.networkworld.com/article/2688724/opensource-subnet/red-hat-ceo-whitehurst-on-devops-apps-and-infrastructure.html

A follow up to a post I included a few weeks back, all about why leading people and management could be for you. Managers play a big part in how culture changes in most organisations and it’s often ignored by technology driven employees.

Akvo.org is a non-profit operating from Amsterdam. We work on increasing visibility for charities and their work, and provide survey and monitoring software in developing countries, especially in Africa and India. We’re searching for an infrastructure engineer ideally versed in Puppet, but in general what we want is someone who knows how to automate provisioning and build continuous delivery pipelines. Experience with Python or Java/Clojure is a plus. The main office is in Amsterdam, but the developers mostly work remotely; we’d prefer someone to be in one of our hubs (Amsterdam, Stockholm or Helsinki) but remote ±2 hours of CEST can work too.

TOOLS

Chef Guard looks like a useful tool, specifically it protects your Chef server from untested and uncommitted cookbooks. Several useful features, including emailing of configuration change diffs and validation of changes.

http://xanzy.io/projects/chef-guard/introduction/overview.html

Learning new tools and languages is always hard so anything that makes it easier it a good idea. Chef Koans takes inspiration from other similar projects and applies it to Chef, a good starting point if you’ve done similar learning exercises before.

If you ever attend, or plan to attend, an industry event you should read this post. Heck, if you plan to leave your house your should read it. Our amazing community has a problem with diversity and anything you can do to make it more welcoming has to be a good thing.

http://bridgetkromhout.com/blog/2014/09/22/four-interactions-that-could-have-gone-better/

By now everyone will probably be aware, but just in case, Bash has a serious vulnerability that probably affects you. This is the best write-up I’ve found which quickly explains how this works and how it could be exploited.

http://www.troyhunt.com/2014/09/everything-you-need-to-know-about.html

My talk from the recent Puppet Conf (disclaimer: I’m now a Puppet Labs employee), all about high level infrastructure testing. Includes a few experiments writing tests against infrastructure APIs and talks a bit about policy driven development.

https://speakerdeck.com/garethr/continuously-testing-infrastructure

A full chapter on infrastructure automation from the Practicing Ruby book, stepping through the why alongside step-by-step examples of Chef recipes.

https://practicingruby.com/articles/infrastructure-automation

I’ve made this point before but not so eloquently. If you’re writing Puppet, Chef or similar DSL based tool then you’re a programmer.

http://cwebber.net/blog/2014/09/26/i-am-not-a-coder/

Syslog is great, except when the standard isn’t actually adhered to. This next post shows how to deal with this situation using logstash and grok filters.

http://kartar.net/2014/09/when-logstash-and-syslog-go-wrong/

At a previous job I a bit of desktop work, so this article about applying modern automation and devops approaches to large scale desktop systems was interesting. Lots of good points and ideas.

http://www.brianmadden.com/blogs/guestbloggers/archive/2014/09/16/is-it-time-for-enterprise-it-to-use-devops-for-smart-automation-of-virtual-desktop-delivery.aspx

A good talk and slide deck which quickly explains the state of networking for docker containers.

http://blog.thestateofme.com/2014/09/12/docker-networking/

It’s difficult to get people to work effectively together if they have never met, so for distributed organisations organising an internal conference is a nice idea. This post covers a few gotchas and an experience report from a recent effort.

TOOLS

The new puppet server was released at Puppet Conf. Puppet server is a drop-in replacement for the current puppet master with some pretty big performance and scalability improvements.

https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-server

If you’re using Route53 DNS then Roadworker should be of interest. It’s a Ruby based DSL for creating zones and records. Good examples too.

https://github.com/winebarrel/roadworker

If like me you’re maintaining a number of puppet modules you probably have an occasional day when you try and remember to update lots of static files (Rakefile, .travis.yml, Gemfile, etc.) across all of them. Modulesync looks a nice solution to that issue.
