Happy Birthday Kevin! Hope you enjoy this poster:) \m/ on! I got tired of the ra-ra cheerleadery bullshit from 99% of tech journalism a few years ago.  I follow economists like Umair Haque and some old school Cluetrain guys like Doc Searls, but it feels like most of what tech journalists cover doesn't apply to building real companies or doing business anywhere but Silicon Valley.  I think TechCrunch is responsible (partly) with the rise of the wantrapreneur and brogrammer cultures.  I spent time at Netscape after they got acquired by AOL and it was diverse and friendly and fun.  I spent time with folks from tons of startups where women were senior managers and brilliant technologists.  Turning building business into a spectator sport created this whole new class of assholes who were attracted to it for the supposed glamour and go-go 80's idea of being acquired by Google.  What they really ended up doing was playing the lottery with other peoples' money and wasting a whole generation of talent that could have changed the world for the better instead of creating curated boxes of shit delivered to people who have more money than sense. whew  Like, every time I see someone who's signed up for Lootcrate or Plated or Graze, I just want to slap them and tell them to save their money and donate to someone who doesn't have food on their table, much less a box of hand-picked endive and a recipe hand-scrawled on parchment.  Not that I would ever say this stuff in public because I'm too nice, but damn.  Aaaaaaand, that's why I work here.  We're solving a real problem and creating a real business.  We're not playing the lottery or building toys for rich people.
